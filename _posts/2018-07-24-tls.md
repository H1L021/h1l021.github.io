[**_Warning : Unfinished post_**]

To secure the transit communication between its web browser and remote servers, _Netscape Communications_ designed the `Secure Sockets Layer` (famously abbriviated as **SSL**) protocol in 1994. The SSLv1 never made it to the public, since it had several shortcomings and flaws :
* It wasn't tamper-proof
* Use of the weak stream cipher RC4
* Vulnerable to replay attacks (no sequence numbers)

SSLv2 was the first publicly released version in 1995, with SSLv3 [RFC6101](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6101) following the next year. The sole purpose of SSL is to provide <abbr title="The act of validating the identity of the other endpoint against some authority">authentication</abbr>, <abbr title="Are you actually reading this!">confidentiality</abbr> and <abbr title="A mechanism to detect message tampering and forgery">integrity</abbr>, although authentication was later added through the use of chain of trust and certificates.

**Definition**: A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate, and indicates certain expected usages of that key.

Here is what a network Evesdroper can learn from intercepting transit traffic :


When you use it correctly, a third-party observer can only infer the connection endpoints (IP layer), type of encryption, as well as the frequency and an approximate amount of data sent, but cannot read or modify any of the actual data.
[_source_](https://hpbn.co/transport-layer-security-tls/)
{:.message}

In 2015 all SSL versions were finally deprecated by the _Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)_ [RFC7568](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7568) due to a long series of known attacks, both on the key exchange mechanisms and the encryption schems. I advise the interested reader to refer to this  Wikipedia [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Attacks_against_TLS/SSL), where you'll find an explanation of previous attacks. Also IETF issued an informational [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457) summarizing all the attacks. And if you're just wondering whether your server has any TLS weaknesses, I highly recommend using this tool, [sslyze](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze), which is a fast and powerful SSL/TLS server scanning python library.

Then comes `Transport Layer Security` (**TLS**), a successor to SSL, now designed and standardized by IETF. *TLS 1.0* was first defined in [RFC2246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2246) in January 1999 as an upgrade of SSL version 3.0, *TLS 1.1* was defined in [RFC4346](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346) in April 2006, *TLS 1.2* defined ini [RFC5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) in August 2008, and now the March 2018 [draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-tls13-28) of **_TLS 1.3_** was approved for use, which will make all secure internet connections faster and safer, due to the elimination of unnecessary handshake steps and the forced use of newer encryption methods.

For the coming information to make sense, I have to insert the general structure of the TLS protocol and its place in the network stack early in the article (don't worry if you don't understand some of the terms).

Before the client and server can start exchanging encrypted data using TLS, both parties must decide on whether to use it in the first place. At a more technical level, and by taking *HTTP* as an example, what would the server expect after a successfull TCP handshake, the start of a TLS handshake or the HTTP request itself ? The root of the problem is that applications can communicate either with or without TLS. To solve the confusion, the client must indicate to the server the setup of a TLS connection. While there are many ways to achieve this, only two are widely used :
1. Assign a different port number, for example, HTTP on 80, HTTPS on 443.
2. Opportunistic TLS : client makes a protocol-specific request to the server, for example, [STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS) for SMTP/IMAP/POP3/FTP ... while using the same port.

Given both ends agreed to use TLS, the famous TLS handshake begins. The handshake consists of a series of exchanged packets (to be more accurate, TLS records) to build a secure tunnel over the otherwise unsecure internet. If you search for images depicting the handshake diagram, you will find many, with each one giving a different graph. The reason behind this, is TLS comes bundled with a huge list of so-called *cipher suites*. Each one gives a sligthly different handshake/diagram. IANA defined a [list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4) of named cipher suites used by TLS.

**Definition**: A cipher suite is a set of algorithms that are used together in a TLS session. The set usually includes: a <ins>key agreement algorithm</ins> for exchanging a symmetric session key to use for encryption, a <ins>bulk encryption algorithm</ins>, and a <ins>message authentication code</ins> for integrity purposes. <ins>Asymmetric algorithms</ins> can also be found in the set mainly for authentication purposes.

The figure given below gives a diagram of TLS handshake when using RSA as the key exchange protocol (for example, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 cipher suite).

As most networking protocols, TLS defines a frame/format as the most basic unit to exchange data. *record* is the name given to this frame. It is actually a whole sub-protocol in itself, and it is stacked directly on top of TCP. The job of the Record protocol is first fragment the higher-layer protocol data (refer to Figure xx) into blocks of 2<sup>14</sup> bytes or less; then optionally compress the data (a step rarely done), adds a Message Authentication Code and finally encrypts the data according to the cipher spec (once negotiated), then add an SSL Record hearder.

The general format of all TLS records is shown below.

**Note**: TLS supports compression of its protocol messages, MAC and padding. To my knowledge, there is no out-of-the-box SSL/TLS implementation that supports it.

Here is a diagram that depicts the process of building an SSL Record by the Record protocol.

The **higher layer** is stacked on top of the Record Protocol. Each of these protocols has a very specific purpose, and are used at different stages of the communication. the  _Content type_ field of the Record header  specifies the higher layer protocol type of the record. The table below gives all possible content types wrapped inside a record.

Hex | Dec | Type
--- | --- | ---
0x14| 20  | ChangeCipherSpec
0x15| 21  | Alert
0x16| 22  | Handshake
0x17| 23  | Application
0x18| 24  | Heartbeat

The _Handshake_ protrocol (Hex 0x16) is the most used record type found within a TCP setup,  in addition to _Alert_ and _ChangeCipherSpec_ protocols. The format of the _Handshake_ protocol within a record frame is shown below.

![Handshake protocol format]({{ "/assets/tls-record-handshake.png" | absolute_path }})
Handshake protocol format [Source][2]
{:.figure}

_Message type_ is the field that identifies the handshake message type, and these are:

| Code | Description |
---  | ---
0 | helloRequest
1 | **ClientHello**
2 | **ServerHello**
4 | NewSessionTicket
11 | **Certificate**
12 | **ServerKeyExchange**
13 | CertificateRequest
14 | **ServerHelloDone**
15 | certificateVerify
16 | **ClientKeyExchange**
20 | **Finished**

The handshake is usually initiated by sending **ClientHello** message. It is sent with a list of client-supported cipher suites for the server to pick the best one, a list of compression methods, and a list of extensions. Here is an example:

~~~
ClientVersion 3,1
ClientRandom[32]
SessionID: None (new session)
Suggested Cipher Suites:
   TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
   TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA
Suggested Compression Algorithm: NONE
~~~

The server responds with a set of handshake messages (often bundled within the same TCP packet), comprising a **ServerHello** where it puts the chiper, compression method and extensions chosen; a **Certificate** message, an optional **ServerKeyExchange** and **ServerHelloDone**. When the _ServerKeyExchange_ doesn't appear in the response from the server, it is usually an indication of a setup of a weak key agreement protocol.

#### RSA, Diffie-Hellman and Forward Secrecy
There are basically two methods to key agreement protocols: either through the use of [_Diffie-Hellman_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie-Hellman_key_exchange) protocol, or one of other public-key algorithms, for example, [RSA][4], [ECDSA][3]. As the name implies, such a protocol aims to securely exchange a session key between two ends.

When <abbr title="Diffie-Hellman">DH</abbr> or one of its variants is not in use, for example, using RSA, the client calculates the master key independently (actually a pre-master key form which the master key is derived) from the server, then encrypts it with the server's public key (which only the owner of the private key can decrypt) and sends it in the **ClientKeyExchange** handshake message. There are two obvious flwas when using this method:
1. If an attacker ever gains access to the server's private key, he can learn the session key and decrypt the otherwise encrypted traffic.
2. Worse, the attacker is not only limited to decrypting traffic of current session, but all recorded previous traffic can be decrypted now.

On the other hand, The session key agreed upon using _Diffie-Hellman_ protocol never leaves the client or server machines, so can not be intercepted by an evesdropper. furthermore, using specific _DH_ variants (ephemeral DH and ephemeral Elliptic Curve DH), one can take advantage of their <abbr title="Perfect Forward Secrecy">PFS</abbr> feature; meaning, even if the private key is compromised at one point in time, none of the previous recorded traffic can be decyrpted.

Often you'll find an additional authentication mechanism used with _DH_ (e.g. RSA, PSK or ECDSA) because _DH_ itslef is an unauthenticated protocol: anyone can claim to be the destination server and start the key exchange with the client.

#### ApplicationData Protocol format
The mission of this protocol is to properly encapsulate the data coming form the Application layer of the network stack.

### Attacking SSL/TLS Heartbeat Extension
[CVE-2014-0160](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160) or most commonly known as [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com/), was the first huge vulnerability in 2014 that wrecked havoc all over the internet. Over 500.000 or so HTTPS certificates may have been compromised by the catastrophic Heartbleed bug. The bug resides within the ubiquitous [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) library, and it occurs due to bounds checking not being performed on a heap value which  is user supplied and returned to the user as part of DTLS/TLS heartbeat SSL extension [RFC6520](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520). All versions of OpenSSL 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f are known affected. A successfull exploit will return a dump up to 65535 bytes of server memory per request. If you get lucky enough, you may end up retrieving the server's private key.

In this section, we will write a python code to exploit this vulnerability; actually it is a re-write of [HackerFantastic](https://github.com/HackerFantastic/Public/blob/master/exploits/heartbleed.c)'s C code exploit.
